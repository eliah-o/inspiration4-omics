# Inspiration4 metagenomics and metatranscriptomics analysis

You can find here the scripts used to run regressions and generate figures for the analysis used in the i4 metagenomics and metatranscriptomics manuscript.

The primary file used to generated figures is i4_swab_metagenomics.Rmd. To reproduce modeling results, we recommend exploring run_regressions.R. For understanding the decontamination process, look at decontam_santize_genedata.R.
